Wrong answer: 
Print your solution! (Print debug output, as well.) 
Are you clearing all DS between test cases? 
Can your algorithm handle the whole range of input? 
Read the full problem statement again. 
Do you handle all corner cases correctly? 
Have you understood the problem correctly? 
Any uninitialized variables? Any overflows? 
Confusing N and M, i and j, etc.? 
Are you sure your algorithm works? 
What special cases have you not thought of? 
Are you sure the STL functions you use work as you think? 
Add some assertions, maybe resubmit. 
Create some testcases to run your algorithm on. 
Go through the algorithm for a simple case. 
Go through this list again. 
Go for a small walk, e.g. to the toilet. Is your output format correct? (including whitespace) 
Recode

Runtime error: In some judges, MLE is considered RTE (Check your memory use) 
Have you tested all corner cases locally? 
Any uninitialized variables? 
Are you reading or writing outside the range of any vector? 
Any assertions that might fail? 
Infinite recursion? 
Any possible division by 0? Ex. mod 0 
Any possible infinite recursion? 
Invalidated pointers or iterators? 
Are you using too much memory? 
Debug with resubmits. 
Force WA (asserts for RTE problems)

Time limit exceeded: 
Do you have any possible infinite loops? 
What is the complexity of your algorithm? 
Are you copying a lot of unnecessary data? (References) 
How big is the input and output? (consider scanf) 
Avoid vector, map. (use arrays/unordered_map) 
What do your teammates think about your algorithm?

Memory limit exceeded: 
What is the max amount of memory your algorithm should need? 
Are you clearing all DS between test cases? 
Infinite recursion? (As in pushing into a DS infinitely)
